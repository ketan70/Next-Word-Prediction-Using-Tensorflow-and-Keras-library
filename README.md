# Next-Word-Prediction-Using-Tensorflow-and-Keras-library
This project aims to develop a next-word prediction model using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The model will be trained on a large corpus of text data and will predict the next word in a given sentence.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is a collection of text documents from various sources. The corpus is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any unwanted characters and symbols.

## Model Architecture
The model uses a deep neural network with multiple layers of LSTM cells. The input to the model is a sequence of words, and the output is the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary of words. The model is trained using the RMSprop optimizer and a categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Results
The trained model is able to predict the next word in a given sentence with high accuracy. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as perplexity and accuracy.
